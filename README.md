# 🌐 Orb Connect

Bridging the digital divide with community-powered connectivity.

## Our Mission

At Orb Connect, we develop decentralized, peer-to-peer broadband solutions to make internet access more affordable and accessible. We focus on creating custom, high-performance hardware and robust, open-source firmware based on OpenWRT.

## Our Work

Our development is built on a history of R&D in low-cost connectivity, including foundational work on the **RNPT** project.

Our current focus is the **Orb Node** platform, which includes:

*   **Orb Node Hardware:** A family of custom-designed Wi-Fi 6 routers that serve as the backbone of our peer-to-peer network.
*   **Orb Node Firmware:** Our tailored OpenWRT-based firmware, featuring custom packages for mesh networking, security, and network management.
